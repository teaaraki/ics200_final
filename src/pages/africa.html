      <h2>Mokele-Mbembe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Republic of the Congo</li>
        <li><b>First Sighting:</b> 1929, but reports of a large animal date back to the 18th century</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Living dinosaur</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mokele-Mbembe is said to be a massive creature living in remote parts of Central Africa. 
        Sightings are often around the Congo River, where locals describe 
        it  as a large amphibious animal with a bulky body, a long neck 
        and tail, and a somewhat small head, a description which has long 
        suggested a sauropod dinosaur.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are many theories that Mokele-Mbembe is just a case of mistaken identity.
          It simply could be the case of a different type of reptile that lives
          in the area.

      <h2>Kongamato</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b>  Zambia / Angola / Congo</li>
        <li><b>First Sighting:</b> 1920's</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> insert</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Kongamato, meaning “overturner of boats,” is a flying cryptid 
        reported in the swampy regions of central Africa. Descriptions 
        closely resemble a living pterosaur: leathery wings, long beak, and 
        no feathers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Early reports from Western explorers noted that locals recognized 
      pterosaur illustrations as the creature they feared. It is said to 
      attack boats and intrude on human settlements. Despite this, no 
      physical evidence has been found to confirm its existence.</p>

      <h2>Nandi Bear</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Kenya</li>
        <li><b>First Sighting:</b> Early 1900's</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Carnivorous Mammal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Nandi Bear, named after the Nandi people of Kenya, is described 
        as a large, shaggy, hyena- or bear-like animal with a sloping back, 
        powerful limbs, and fearsome strength. It's known in local folklore 
        as a man-eater, feared for its aggressive nature.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While no scientific evidence confirms its existence, colonial-era 
        reports and continued local legends have fueled speculation that the 
        creature may be a surviving prehistoric animal, a misidentified hyena, 
        or even a case of mass folklore. Some believe it could be a relic 
        population of short-faced bears or chalicotheres.</p>

      <h2>Man-Eating Tree</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Madagascar</li>
        <li><b>FirstSighting:</b> 1874</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Carnivorous Plant</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In 1881 German explorer "Carl Liche" wrote an account in the South 
        Australian Register of encountering a sacrifice performed by the 
        "Mkodo" tribe of Madagascar. Writing:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>
        "The slender delicate palps, with the fury of starved serpents, 
        quivered a moment over her head, then as if with instinct and 
        demonic intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and 
        round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more 
        awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into 
        a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green 
        serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted 
        themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever-tightening 
        with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon 
        their prey."</i></p>
