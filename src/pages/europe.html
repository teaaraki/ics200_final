      <h2>Lock Ness Monster</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Scotland</li>
        <li><b>First Sighting:</b> 565 AD</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Sea Monster</li>
      </ul>
      <p>  The Loch Ness Monster, affectionately nickenamed Nessie, is 
        perhaps the most iconic figure in cryptozoology. Nessie has 
        become a near-synonym for the field itself and has received 
        more sustained media attention than almost any other cryptid, 
        rivaled only by Bigfoot and perhaps beings like the so-called 
        Grey Aliens.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Sightings commonly describe a creature about twenty feet long, 
        with sleek, rubbery black-gray skin and a long, serpentine 
        body lined with humps. It's often said to have paddle-like 
        limbs (or short legs), and a head vaguely shaped like a horse's—
        sometimes with a shaggy mane, small horns, or a crest. A rounder,
         turtle-like head is also reported, and this is the version most 
         often seen in famous photographs.</p>

      <h2>Kraken</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Norway</li>
        <li><b>First Sighting:</b> 13th Century</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Giant Cephalopod</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The Kraken is a legendary sea monster said to dwell off the 
        coast of Norway and Greenland. First described in Norse sagas 
        and later chronicled in scientific texts of the 18th century, 
        the Kraken was often depicted as a massive, tentacled beast 
        capable of dragging entire ships beneath the waves. Its size was 
        exaggerated in folklore, sometimes said to span over a mile in 
        length, with arms that could wrap around a vessel. </p>
        <br><p>
        Though commonly compared to a giant squid, the Kraken blends fact 
        and fiction—possibly inspired by sightings of real deep-sea 
        creatures like the colossal squid. For centuries, sailors feared 
        it as a deadly menace of the deep, cementing its place in 
        maritime myth and cryptozoology.</p>

      <h2>Lagarfljót Worm</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Country:</b> Iceland</li>
        <li><b>Sighting:</b> 1345</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> Lake Serpant</li>
      </ul>
      <p>  The Lagarfljót Worm, or <i>Lagarfljótsormurinn</i>, is a legendary 
        lake monster said to inhabit Lake Lagarfljót in eastern Iceland. 
        First recorded in 1345, the creature is described as a massive, 
        serpentine being, sometimes with humps or coils that rise above 
        the water’s surface. According to folklore, it originated from a 
        small "lingworm" placed on a gold ring to grow—believed to 
        increase the ring’s value—which eventually grew so large and
         monstrous it had to be thrown into the lake. The worm is said 
         to cause mysterious disturbances in the water and has 
         occasionally been blamed for damage to boats and property.
         </p>
         <br><p> 
         Modern sightings continue to be reported, including a 2012 viral 
         video that sparked renewed debate. Whether myth, 
         misidentification, or something more, the Lagarfljót Worm 
         remains one of Iceland's most enduring and enigmatic legends.</p>

        <h2>Baba Yaga</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Country:</b> Russia, and Slavic Regions</li>
          <li><b>Sighting:</b> 1755</li>
          <li><b>Type:</b> Witch</li>
        </ul>
        <p>    Baba Yaga is a legendary witch-like entity from Slavic 
          folklore, often considered more than just a myth. Descriptions 
          vary, but she is typically portrayed as an unnaturally old 
          woman with iron teeth, sunken eyes, and a long hooked nose. 
          Witnesses—both folkloric and anecdotal—describe her dwelling 
          deep in the forest in a mobile hut that stands on giant 
          chicken legs. She's said to fly in a mortar and steer with a 
          pestle, often accompanied by strange winds and unsettling 
          sounds.</p>
          <br><p>
            Though many accounts depict her as hostile or predatory, 
            others suggest she can act as a guardian of hidden knowledge 
            or even help those who approach her with respect. While 
            rooted in folk tales, Baba Yaga has continued to appear in 
            modern reports, particularly in isolated rural areas, 
            leading some to speculate about her status as a cryptid or 
            supernatural entity.</p>
