            Over the past few years, 
            rumors have circulated in Japan about the existence of 
            polar Humanoid Life Forms inhabiting the icy waters of the 
            Antarctic called Ningen (人間, "Ningen", meaning "human").
            Reportedly observed on multiple occasions by crew members of 
            government-operated "whale research" ships, these so-called Ningen 
            are said to be completely white in color with an estimated length 
            of 20 to 30 meters. Eyewitnesses describe them having a human-like 
            shape, often with legs, arms, and even five-fingered hands. Sometimes 
            they are described as having fins or a large mermaid-like tail instead 
            of legs, or even tentacles and cephalopod arms and sometimes they are 
            armless small bipedal humanoids, similar to the Fresno Nightcrawlers.
</p>
<p>
            Most of the photo evidence of the Ningen was either hoaxed or 
            artistic interpretations. According to Wikipedia.org, the 
            Ningen first appeared on the Internet in the mid-2000s and was 
            most likely an Internet hoax.

    <h2 class="cryptid-name">The Yeti</h2>
    <div class="cryptid-container right-image-asia">

      <div class="cryptid-info">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Country:</strong> Himalayan Mountains</li>
          <li><strong>First Mention:</strong> 1832</li>
          <li><strong>Type:</strong> Humanoid Primate</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Yeti is known as the "Abominable Snowman" since it hails from the 
      cold climate of the Himalayas — and because its name loosely translates 
      to "metoh-kangmi," which means "man-bear snowman." However, this elusive 
      creature doesn't look like a snowman at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covered in brown fur, the Yeti reportedly resembles a human-gorilla 
      hybrid or possibly even a bear, and it stands more than 11 feet (3.3 
      meters) tall.

    <div class="cryptid-container left-image-asia">
      <img src="assets/mongoliandeathworm.jpg" alt="Mongolian Death Worm" />
      <div class="cryptid-info">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Country:</strong> Mongolia</li>
          <li><strong>First Sighting:</strong> 11th Century</li>
          <li><strong>Type:</strong> Worm-like</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Mongolian Death Worm's native name, Olgoi-Khorkhoi, means 
      "intestine worm" due to its red, blood-like color and size. It has 
      been described by many people as being from 2–7 feet long and having 
      the ability to spit out corrosive yellow saliva and generate blasts of 
      electricity. However, this latter power is thought to be folkloric by 
      Gobi nomads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody is entirely sure what the worm actually is. Experts are certain 
      it is not a real worm because the Gobi Desert is too hot for annelids. 
      Some suggest it might be a skink, but they have legs and scales, unlike 
      the limbless, smooth-bodied descriptions. The most likely explanation is 
      a new species of amphisbaenia or worm-lizard — a group of burrowing 
      reptiles.

    <h2 class="cryptid-name">Ahool</h2>
    <div class="cryptid-container right-image-asia">
      <img src="assets/ahool.png" alt="Ahool" />
      <div class="cryptid-info">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Country:</strong> Indonesia (Java)</li>
          <li><strong>First Mention:</strong> 1920's</li>
          <li><strong>Type:</strong> Giant Bat-like Creature</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p>
        The Ahool is a cryptid said to inhabit the rainforests of Java. 
        It is described as a giant bat or flying primate with an enormous 
        wingspan—reportedly up to 10 feet wide—and a face that resembles a 
        monkey or flat-nosed ape. Its name comes from the distinctive cry 
        it is said to make: “Ahooool!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe it could be a previously unknown species of bat or a 
        surviving pterosaur, though others think it may just be a 
        misidentified large owl or fruit bat. Despite its terrifying size 
        and appearance, reports of attacks are rare—most sightings are 
        brief glimpses at dusk or night.
